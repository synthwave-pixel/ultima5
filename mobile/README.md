# Ultima V for Android

The built game wrapped in [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) as an
Android app, for handhelds such as the AYN Odin, the Retroid Pocket and
any phone or tablet that can sideload an APK. iOS is left out on purpose:
installing outside the App Store is more trouble than the web version's
Add to Home Screen.

## What the app does

- Loads the game from its own files (`app/`, packed into the APK) over
  Capacitor's `https://localhost` origin, so storage, the clipboard and
  the Gamepad API behave as in a browser. The service worker is dropped:
  updates are new APKs, and the saved game stays in the app's storage
  across them.
- Runs full screen in landscape with the system bars hidden; a swipe from
  an edge shows them for a moment.
- Maps the system Back button (and a handheld's Back key) to Escape, which
  opens the game's Pause menu. Sent to the background (Home, or another
  app), the game opens the Pause menu too, so it waits there on return.
- Offers Quit on the title menu, which closes the app through
  Capacitor's App plugin (`@capacitor/app`, `App.exitApp()`); a web page
  has no such plugin, so the site offers no Quit.
- Choose folder... on the installer opens Android's own folder picker,
  and Export's To a file its picker for where a new file goes (the
  GameFolder plugin, `GameFolderPlugin.java`), both with no storage
  permission. A web view downloads nothing, so the app writes the file
  itself. Import's From a file needs no plugin: Capacitor's web view
  answers the page's file input with the system's picker.
- Physical controls that Android reports as a gamepad switch the game to
  controller mode on the first press; a tap on the screen shows the
  virtual controller instead.

The app stays on Capacitor 7, which targets Android API 35, and the Back
mapping depends on it. `MainActivity.java` catches `KEYCODE_BACK`, which
Android stops delivering to apps that target API 36 when they run on
Android 16: Back would leave the app instead of opening the Pause menu.
Capacitor 8 targets API 36, so moving to it means moving the mapping too,
to the App plugin's `backButton` listener or an `OnBackPressedCallback`.
API 36 also ends the landscape lock on screens 600dp and wider, so tablets
would turn to portrait. The handhelds this app is for are well served by
Capacitor 7, so it stays until there is a reason to move; the App plugin
is held to its Capacitor 7 release (`@capacitor/app@^7`) with it.

## Obtainium

[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) can install the APK
from the latest release and update it from later ones, given this
repository (`https://github.com/synthwave-pixel/ultima5`) as the source.
The APK is the only `.apk` in a release, so no asset filter is needed.

## Building

Requirements: Node 22, a JDK (17 or newer) and the Android SDK with
platform 35 and build-tools (Android Studio installs them; on a CI runner
they are preinstalled).

```sh
cd web && npm ci && cd ../mobile && npm ci
npm run bundle          # builds ../web with VITE_BASE=./ into app/
npx cap sync android    # copies app/ and the plugin list into android/
npm run apk             # dist/Ultima-V-<version>-android.apk
```

`node ../web/tools/icons.mjs` regenerates the launcher icons, with the
web and desktop ones, from the pixel art drawn in that script.

## Signing

Android refuses an unsigned APK, and refuses to update an app whose new
build is signed with a different key. `sideload.keystore` is therefore
committed: every CI build signs with it, so one build installs over the
last and keeps its saves. It is a sideload key only; it proves nothing
beyond "built from this repository's CI", and its password is in
`android/app/build.gradle`.

For a release key of your own, set four repository secrets and the
workflow uses them instead: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (the keystore file,
base64), `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and
`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`. Locally, the same names as environment variables
(with `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE` as the path) do the same.

## Versions

`apk.cjs` takes the version from `../desktop/version.cjs`, the one source
for every build: in Actions the major.minor from `desktop/package.json`
with the run number as the patch, elsewhere a timestamped pre-release.
Android's `versionCode`, which must rise for a build to install over the
last, is the run number in Actions and minutes-since-2024 for a local
build, so a developer's APK installs over any release; going back to a
release after that means uninstalling first. `package.json` here carries
no version of its own. The `android/` folder is Capacitor's
generated project, kept in git as Capacitor intends, with these local
changes: the version and signing block in `app/build.gradle`,
`screenOrientation` in the manifest, `MainActivity.java`, the icons, the
black splash and launcher background.
