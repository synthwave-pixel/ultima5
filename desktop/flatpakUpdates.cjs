// The Flatpak's own updates (updates.cjs), through Flatpak's update portal - org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak, which
// every Flatpak may talk to without a permission of its own. Discover updates a Flatpak only in Desktop Mode, so on a
// Steam Deck played in Game Mode a release would otherwise wait for the player's trip to the desktop. The portal lets
// the app ask, from inside its sandbox, for its own newer commit to be pulled from the remote it was installed from
// (here the site's signed repository, flatpak-repo.sh) and deployed beside the running one, verified as flatpak
// verifies any update; the copy playing keeps running, and the next start is the new version.
//
//   1. CreateUpdateMonitor: an UpdateMonitor object for this app, whose UpdateAvailable signal the portal sends when
//      it looks at the remote (half an hour after the monitor is made, and every half hour) and finds something changed
//      - its first look always, newer or not - with the commits running, deployed (local) and on the remote.
//   2. Update on that monitor, when the remote's commit is newer than the deployed one - or at once, when GitHub's
//      newest release is newer than this copy (the portal's own look is half an hour away). One deployed already (by
//      Discover, while the game played) is only told of. Its Progress signal says how it goes: running (0), nothing to
//      do (1: the repository not yet holding the release, the Pages deploy a few minutes behind it; the portal's signal
//      comes when it does), done (2), failed (3, with the D-Bus error's name and message).
//
// The first Update asks the player, once: "Update Ultima V?", through the desktop's Access portal, the answer kept in
// the permission store (table flatpak, id updates; flatpak permission-show) and never asked again. Under Steam's
// Game Mode there may be no Access portal to ask it (gamescope's holo portal) and the update fails; started once in
// Desktop Mode and allowed there, the game updates itself in Game Mode from then on - which the player is told
// (updates.cjs, the reason the update failed: approve). The question comes before the portal looks for anything to
// update, so the game asks it at its first start at the desktop (watch's `approve`), an Update with nothing newer -
// answered there, where it can be, rather than at the first release, in Game Mode, where it may not. Turned down, it is never asked again, and the player is told
// how to allow it (denied); a release asking for a permission the installed one lacks is never self-updated
// (Discover).
//   3. Done: the game is told the update is installed, and a restart plays it - Spawn with FLATPAK_SPAWN_FLAGS_LATEST_
//      VERSION starts the newest deployed version in a sandbox of its own, and this one quits. Under Steam's Game Mode
//      the restart is only a quit: a game started outside Steam is not shown there, so the player starts it again from
//      the library.
//
// Where the portal cannot be had - an old flatpak (no UpdateMonitor before the portal's version 4), no session bus -
// or the update fails, connect() or watch() says so and updates.cjs falls back to telling the player of the release.
// The signals come only to the connection that made the monitor, so the D-Bus talk is in process (@particle/dbus-next),
// not through gdbus.
